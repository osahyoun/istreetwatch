I sat downstairs in the back and was facing the back row and a middle aged white English man who was mumbling to himself.  At first I ignored it as this happens often on buses in London but then I could hear him saying nasty things and after a few minutes of me sitting on the bus the man sitting next to me asked the English man what his problem was. I could only  imagine he'd been enduring his insults for a while now. Then the English man started yelling and tell him to 'f*ck off'. By this point the European man was agitated and told him to behave himself but the English man kept yelling and then when the European man asked who he thought he was talking to him like that, the English man yelled 'I am English and you can f*ck off'.  At this point most passengers including me told him to f*ck off and that he was a disgrace to this country. The English man kept yelling and European man's partner told him to calm down and luckily at that point we arrived at the top of Muswell Hill where most of the passengers (including the couple) got off. The English man stayed in the back seat whilst the passengers left on the bus (including myself) went to sit far away from him.  Shortly after this another man went over to congratulate the English man for sticking up for 'us'. This was horrible to say the least. I couldn't contain myself and told him to 'f*ck off' as well.  He didn't respond to me and luckily for me a very nice lady calmed me down. Needless to say I was very angry and shaken.

Following the abuse, former Haslingden High School pupil Arry said she felt “compelled” to write a blog post about her experience and share it with others.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said: “Did the man pick on us as we were a easy target – just a young woman and young child?

For me - and I acknowledge I have been blessed never in my life to have experienced this directly before - these were first time feels. My body instantly wanted to be as far away as possible. My eyes wanted to stare her down. My heart wanted to both break and thunderously roar with rage. My lips couldn't speak but my tongue wanted to say, nah luv, there is no space big enough for both of us to fit, there's no world big enough for me and you and all your pettiness and all your hate. I looked at her. She was pregnant, quite heavily, with empty, unimaginative Daily Mail eyes and a grim, hollow, unreachable stare, and she sat on the tube with her squinty, brittle, pockmarked husband and they downed a magnum of Smirnoff Ice and cussed and grumbled all the way to Bank. And I realised that she was too pathetic and lost to deserve my pain.\\r\\nWe live in a divided world. Whether you are just suddenly reeling at the acknowledgement of this or whether you have always known it, felt it, experienced it, suffered from it, we must not park our collective reactionary response at anger, anguish, resentment, cynicism, or entrench ourselves deeper within our categorised comfort zones. We must all play our part in disembowelling this monstrous invention of whiteness. Racists and bigots, they're the metastases. We have to get to the cancer. We must dismantle the dominant narratives that fuel white supremacy and confront directly the systems of power that insist and thrive on keeping it alive. We must confront ourselves. We must all acknowledge what it has offered to us and what it has kept from us by virtue of the colour of our skin, the colour of our passport, where we exist in the world and on the neoliberal economic ladder. We must empathise, listen to each other's stories, believe them. We must allow each other time to catch up, without malice or scorn. But seriously, do dig deep and catch up. If you don't know, go know. We owe it to ourselves, to each other, to our futures to do this. Let's take this collectively shitty feeling and do the work. We live in this world together. We must fight for it together.

Saw a large group of about 15 white kids (aged 13 - 15) on Boris Bikes having an argument with three young French guys (aged 19-20), two of them people of colour.

One of the kids then punched one of the French guys in the face, and the others jumped on him, kicking and punching him as he was on the floor. Another of the French guys was punched in the face. I ran in, shouting 'stop' really loudly and repeatedly and stood in the way of some of the kids. The kids then ran off. The guy who was most badly attacked was left with a nasty gash above his eye and they were all very shaken. Another person who was cycling by called the police.\\r\\nIt seems the police mobilised quickly and were searching the area, and said they'd caught and were holding a couple of kids who matched the description of the attackers. But the police were really pushy and didn't treat the victims with much sympathy or respect. They wanted the main victim to get into the police car and drive past the person they'd caught to identify him, but the victim was very hesitant and didn't really want to do that. The police were quite aggressive in response to this implying that the victim was 'wasting their time', and not giving any attention to the fact that the victim didn't speak much English and was obviously really shaken up from having been attacked. The police weren't interested in my telling them that I thought the attack was racially motivated, or the abusive things the attackers had been shouting at the victims. \",\"summary\":null,\"approved\":true,\"postcode\":\"SE1 2SW\",\"country\":\"United Kingdom\",\"region\":\"Greater London\",\"informant_email\":null,\"informant_name\":\"\",\"created_at\":\"2016-08-04T11:55:52.038Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-08-07T03:14:49.459Z\",\"support\":\"I intervened as described above.

They kept asking him what happened, and when he started telling them, just cutting him off with other questions asked in an intimidating way or statements that he wasn't cooperating with their 'attempts to help him'. I tried to get the police to tell me how they were going to investigate going forward. But one of the cops said that, because the victims were French and going back to France soon (they were in London on holiday), it would be 'hard to stay in touch' and so the investigation might not go very far.. The same police officer also told me that they had detained a black man down the road, but then let him go as he 'didn't match the description'.

There's almost always someone begging there, and today there was a woman in a colourful headscarf. There were a lot of noisy and drunk Rangers fans around, laughing and chanting and reeling. I heard something odd and looked behind me: one man had just dropped some change in her cup, but his friend was crouched down in front of her and shouting in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Can I have some money?! Can I have some money?! We give you money so you should give me money! Come on, give me some money!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned around and walked up and put myself between her and him.

I wasn't sure it was de-escalating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm homeless and I've got two kids and no money and I'm a British citizen! I'm a British citizen! We give them money and where's my money?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I hear you, I hear you, but could you leave her alone please?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen his friend came up and got in my face too. \\\"*I* gave her change!\\\" he said angrily at me, as if that somehow gave his friend the right to harass her. Or maybe he saw me asking them to leave her alone as an all-out attack on them, I don't know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know, I saw, but could you leave her alone now?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a third friend swaggered past and put his arms around the first guy's shoulders, pulling him away. He didn't say anything to me, but it seemed like a more effective de-escalation strategy than mine. They all careened off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned to the woman and said, \\\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I don't have any change to give you. I'm so sorry.\\\" She smiled at me and said thank you, and I tried to ask her what help she needed. It took me a bit too long to realise we didn't speak the same language and I was too upset to communicate. I walked away saying sorry. A few paces away, Darcy, who was with me, asked if I wanted to get her some food, and I remembered I had a Sainsbury's meal deal in my bag. I got it out, digging in my bag on the steps of the Ladbrokes. \\\"Fucksake,\\\" said a man leaving and tripping past my stuff. I got out the sandwich and crisps and juice and offered them to the woman. She nodded and smiled and I think was saying yes, so I left them by her and said \\\"Take care.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was upset, but strangely calm through the whole thing. I didn't feel scared -- even though, as I realised later, I was wearing tiny denim hotpants and a flowery top, though happily that never seemed to factor into the conflict -- but I did feel very ashamed that all this was happening.

It didn't bother me too much as it was just a few people here and there. Later in the year 2015 i noticed that more and more people were doing this and I wondered why. \\r\\n\\r\\nI'm a local delivery driver and be on the roads alot. I confirmed that some other drivers were also noticing this i.e taxi and food delivery drivers. At first it was just white people doing this but then noticed black people were also doing this. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of 2016 I noticed changes in the racist behaviour in even most of the regular spitters where they would wipe or pick their noses whenever they saw a south asian person drive past. Now they either wipe or pick noses or wipe their head or play with hair. Some people even scrape their shoe on the floor then look at it. Some people do a fake short cough. Now white, black and some indian people do this too as if they want to differentiate themselves from muslims.  Over the last few months it is steadily getting worse. 3 large white males spat in my direction in a car park. Small children do the nose wiping gestures as well as many many other members of society. I have always been a peace loving and nice person and I find this very difficult to take in. I've lost weight through stressing about this. I went past some girls the other day and they all simultaneously punched their palms as if to say I'll be attacked soon. I went on a late delivery another day and 3 black youngsters on bicycles called me a dirty paki. I know nothing can be done about this but felt i should tell somebody. Another time last month i was driving along and a white boy on a bicycle threw a stone at my car causing the passenger mirror to break. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople in my street used to talk to me. Im the one of the only muslim in my street and me and my family suffer from some verbal abuse now and again. Now everyone ignores us after wiping their noses at us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot even go to asda without ppl doing this common nose wiping gesture so I get the food delivered when possible.  I live in the west midlands and when going out of the area to places where there r no ethnic minorities notice that every one is polite and normal the way they used to be around here.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow this hate is being spread and its being spread to all cultures against muslims especially.
