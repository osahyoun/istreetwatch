At first I ignored it as this happens often on buses in London but then I could hear him saying nasty things and after a few minutes of me sitting on the bus the man sitting next to me asked the English man what his problem was. I could only  imagine he'd been enduring his insults for a while now. Then the English man started yelling and tell him to 'f*ck off'. By this point the European man was agitated and told him to behave himself but the English man kept yelling and then when the European man asked who he thought he was talking to him like that, the English man yelled 'I am English and you can f*ck off'.  At this point most passengers including me told him to f*ck off and that he was a disgrace to this country. The English man kept yelling and European man's partner told him to calm down and luckily at that point we arrived at the top of Muswell Hill where most of the passengers (including the couple) got off. The English man stayed in the back seat whilst the passengers left on the bus (including myself) went to sit far away from him.  Shortly after this another man went over to congratulate the English man for sticking up for 'us'. This was horrible to say the least. I couldn't contain myself and told him to 'f*ck off' as well.  He didn't respond to me and luckily for me a very nice lady calmed me down. Needless to say I was very angry and shaken.

I am one of those people they call an 'ex-pat', living on my old age pension in France. Britain just had a referendum but I was not allowed to vote because I have been living here over 15 years. I can only assume that was because I am now regarded as friends with those naughty foreign French people, even though the results of that referendum now threaten my very survival since I suffer from a long term illness which requires regular medical treatment and there is a danger of my medical cover being withdrawn if the UK does exit.
